                            <p>
                                Before we get into knowing and studying different types of
                                aircrafts, let us understand how are these aircrafts classified.
                                In most common terms, there are two types of classifications for
                                aircrafts. One is lighter than air aircrafts, known as aerostats,
                                and the other is heavier than air aircrafts, called aerodynes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aerostats (Lighter Than Air): Aerostats or lighter than air
                                aircrafts are very more lightweight in weight. These types of
                                light aircraft generally use buoyancy like ships, which helps them
                                float in the air. Low-density gas such as hydrogen, helium, or hot
                                air balloons is used to fill in the aircraft. This low-density gas
                                is lighter than air, hence the name. The most common types of
                                aerostats known to us are hot air balloons and sky lanterns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aerodynes (Heavier Than Air): Alternatively, the other aircraft,
                                heavier than air or aerodynes, as we understand, is much higher in
                                weight and size. They push the gas or air downwards, which
                                reaction helps to make aircraft upwards. Since these are dynamic
                                through movements in the air, they are called aerodynes. This
                                dynamic lift through the air can be caused mostly through
                                mechanisms, as you must have already known.

                                land both water and ground. They are used as both seaplanes or
                                flying boats, or also airplanes. In this aircraft, the engine is
                                either placed in front or even above the wing, that is most
                                commonly found in floatplanes. On the other hand, modern and other
                                amphibious aircraft have engine and propeller placed above the
                                wings. The size of amphibians differs as per the purpose; there
                                are military amphibians, leisure purpose seaplanes, and civil
                                amphibious aircraft.

                                Helicopter aircraft, also known as a chopper, is commonly known to
                                most of us and belongs to rotorcrafts. Horizontally spinning
                                rotors help and aid the helicopter to lift and thrust. These
                                aircraft have the advantage of taking vertically, horizontally,
                                and fly both backward and forward or laterally. Unlike the other
                                fixed-wing aircraft, these benefit from taking off and land at
                                several places and flying even in congested areas. The engine
                                depends on the size, purpose, and function of the chopper. Today,
                                the helicopter is mostly used for military purposes, cargo,
                                construction, rescue, tourism, aerial observation, and the
                                government. The size of the chopper hence mostly depends on the
                                usage.

                                Biplanes come under the category of fixed-wing aircraft. In this
                                category, two wings come one above each other on both sides. This
                                kind of plane is among the first aircraft to discover fixed-wing
                                planes. The biplanes have lower weight but with excellent
                                stiffness and efficiency. The biplanes are fitted with
                                reciprocating engines. Only two adults, in most cases, can do
                                these. In most cases, biplanes are spotted and used for army and
                                military purposes of specific countries. These aircraft were among
                                the most commonly used ones during world war times.

                                different from other airships and aircraft categories. While most
                                confuse them with airships, the balloons are distinct in that they
                                do not possess any engine and cannot change their direction,
                                except for up and down. The balloon’s top is called an envelope,
                                and the bottom part is a basket where people can sit. The most

                                Gliders come again under the category of fixed-wing aircraft. The
                                types of gliders aircraft are used through air reaction against
                                lifting surfaces and mostly do not use any engine. Although small
                                engines may be used as required (in cases like a motor glider),
                                most glider aircraft are efficient for self-take without engines.
                                A wheeled undercarriage helps in take-off or landing. In the past,
                                gliders are used for military purposes and wars; however,
                                nowadays, we even see them in tourist activities and entertainment

                                gliders and paragliders. Most gliders are small in size and can
                                fit a maximum of two people.

                                Gyroplanes, also known as autogyro or gyrocopter, is a rotorcraft
                                aircraft category that uses rotor machines to lift. They are
                                similar to helicopters in appearance, although a bit narrow, and
                                have an engine-driven propeller. The air flows help the gyroplanes
                                lift upwards, and the rotor self-propels as per the way air flows
                                through it. While gyroplanes or autogyros are mostly used for
                                military and war purposes during the 20th century, nowadays, they
                                are spotted in the Olympics and police departments at some states.

                                creating drag to land. They are made through lightweight yet
                                stable and fitting fabric such as nylon or silk. Most parachutes
                                may be in the shapes of round, dome, or inverted dome. Although
                                most parachutes are spotted during leisure activities and
                                entertainment, they are also used and deployed by state and
                                operations during expeditions to ice areas such as polar ends.
                                Only one or two maximum can fit in one parachute.

                                people, even individuals. While they are costly due to their
                                design, plush appearance, and very sophisticated looks, the
                                business jets are used by different classes of people – from

                                Tiltrotors use powered rotors for propulsion and to generate lift.
                                These powered rotors, also called proprotors, are added to
                                rotating shafts of a fixed-wing. These use transverse rotor design
                                and combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter. The
                                rotors, similar to the chopper, helps lift this aircraft. However,
                                the propulsion is much more efficient and can avoid retreating
                                blade stall, commonly seen in choppers. The speed and range are
                                heavier and higher than a normal helicopter and almost near a
                                fixed-wing aircraft. The altitude capability of tiltrotors is
                                higher than helicopters.
